<!-- 
Q. why use Airthmetics operator
:-Arithmetic operators are used to perform calculations on numeric data in a field [example : a+b a,b operand , + operator ]



Q.Unary Arithmetic Operators in C
The unary arithmetic operators operate or work with a single operand. In jss,
 we have two unary arithmetic operators which are as follows:

Operator	Symbol	Operation	Implementation
Decrement Operator	
—

Decreases the integer value of the variable by one.	
Increment Operator	
++

Increases the integer value of the variable by one.	
Unary Plus Operator	
+

Returns the value of its operand.	
Unary Minus Operator	
–

Returns the negative of the value of its operand.	-->
