                              What is Computer?
A computer is a programmable electronic device that accepts raw data as input and processes it with a set of instructions (a program) to produce the result as output. It renders output just after performing mathematical and logical operations and can save the output for future use. It can process numerical as well as non-numerical calculations. The term "computer" is derived from the Latin word "computare" which means to calculate.

A computer is designed to execute applications and provides a variety of solutions through integrated hardware and software components. It works with the help of programs and represents the decimal numbers through a string of binary digits. It also has a memory that stores the data, programs, and result of processing. The components of a computer such as machinery that includes wires, transistors, circuits, hard disk are called hardware. Whereas, the programs and data are called software.

It is believed that the Analytical Engine was the first computer which was invented by Charles Babbage in 1837. It used punch cards as read-only memory. Charles Babbage is also known as the father of the computer.

The basic parts without which a computer cannot work are as follows:

Processor: It executes instructions from software and hardware.
Memory: It is the primary memory for data transfer between the CPU and storage.
Motherboard: It is the part that connects all other parts or components of a computer.
Storage Device: It permanently stores the data, e.g., hard drive.
Input Device: It allows you to communicate with the computer or to input data, e.g., a keyboard.
Output Device: It enables you to see the output, e.g., monitor.
Computers are divided into different types based on different criteria. Based on the size, a computer can be divided into five types:
